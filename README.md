In these repository I gonna post the solutions for "Advent of Code 2021" project tasks.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

### Some key elements of my coding adventure:
- I use python, every file named dayN.py contains solution(s) of Nth day tasks (so, two tasks per day/file)
- I try to spend not more then 120 min per day for the tasks (not including cleaning and make the code prettier - which I can do later on the day/week)
- I do not copy the input data into repository

### Special thanks for ideas
- For Day1 (already): thanks to [Leli](https://github.com/lelilia) for reminding me about types and existence of numpy ðŸ’•

### Temporary notes:
- Day 4 code is still in a cleaning stage...
